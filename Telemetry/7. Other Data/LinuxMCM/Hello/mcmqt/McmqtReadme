Mcmqt program is documented in mcmcom.sxw report. 
This ReadMe file details the installation of mcmqt program under a Linux PC.


PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS
- A RS 232-485 converter card must be connected on the PC serial port.
- mcmdriver must be loaded on the proper serial port.
- QT designer must be installed in the Linux PC.


INSTALLATION
- make a directory mcmqt/
- copy the source code in mcmqt 
- compile the code with qmake (rm Makefile if already existing), and make,
mcmcom executable is created
- copy mcmcom in /usr/bin/ and change its permissions with
	chmod u+s /usr/bin/mcmcom
After this, any user can call this program with mcmcom command.


NOTE:
Modification can required between QT designer versions. The code was developped under 
QT 3.1.1. For QT 3.0.3, further steps were needed:

1) In QT, mcmCom.ui.h shows a different file with nothing inside functions.
Open mcmCom.ui.h with another text editor (like Nedit), the original file appears.
Copy the original file and paste it inside QT mcmCom.ui.h file.
Save.

2) 'qmake mcmcom.pro' fails since there is no /images/ directory.
In QT, remove the file main.cpp from the project.
Then create a new one with File > New > cpp Main-File (Main Form mcmCOM).
Save, and from shell retype 
	qmake mcmcom.pro

3) 'make' returns an error in .moc/moc-mcmCom.cpp, line 169.
Replace		*((char[8*)static_QUType_ptr.get(_o+4))
by		(char[8])static_QUType_ptr.get(_o+4)
Save and retry make.

4) In this QT, there is no Monospace format for DDEdit applet (bottom right).
Change it to Nimbus Mono 14. Resize, save and recompile with make.
